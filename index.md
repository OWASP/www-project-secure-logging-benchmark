OWASP Foundation Web Respository : 
Logging and monitoring is often an after thought, or something that is built by developer for developers. This project moved the mindset of the Developer from measuring system and preformance metrics or debugging towards logging holistically. This project is a movement more than it is a standard. Logs give insights into code quality and bad logs can be a symptom of bad code. This project contains training material and approached to move your logs to build in security and forensics capabillities within the development cycle. This project will cover a varienty of things to consider within designing the logging that is best for your application. It includes a Benchmarking tool which is still in development to rate your logs in terms of maturity in terms of system monitoring, performance metrics, forensic information and even deductables for sensitive data disclosure. The aim is to empower developers to better develop logs with future breaches in mind. This is not a silver bullet but a tool to guiding how you think and approach logs.
