Logging and monitoring is often an afterthought, or something that is built by developers for developers. This project
moved the mindset of the developer from measuring system and performance metrics or debugging towards holistic logging. This project is a movement more than it is a standard. Logs give insights into code quality, and bad logs can be a symptom of bad code. This project contains training material and approaches to move your logs to build in
security and forensics capabilities within the development cycle. This project will cover a variety of considerations in designing the logging that is best for your application. It includes a benchmarking tool, which is still in development, to rate the maturity of your logs, in terms of system monitoring, performance metrics, forensic
information and even deductables for sensitive data disclosure. The aim is to empower developers to better develop logs
with future breaches in mind. This is not a silver bullet, but a tool to guide how you think and approach logs.
